1)The meaning of platform-independent is that the java compiled code can run on all java. 
A program is written in a language that is a human-readable language. 
It may contain words, phrases which the machine cannot understand.



2) primitive and non primitive data types
primitive types are :-
	String and ClassName 
non primitive data types are:-
	byte,int,char,boolaen,long,short,double,float.
In primitive data types the it starts with the upper case. 
In non primitive data types it starts with the lowwer case. 
data types are n number.
data types are only 8 types.


3) class and its member 
class:-class is design which consist of states and behvariers.
	in class we have 
	UserName
	varibles
	declartion 
	methods
eg of class:-
class User{

	public static void main(String []a){
	int a=1;
	System.out.println(a);
	
	}

}

4)program
class Calculation{

	public static void main(String [] arg){
	int totalMarks=600;
	int receivedMarks=500;
	
	double percentage=((receivedMarks/totalMarks)*100);
	
	System.out.println(percentage);
		return;
	}
}

5)program
class Array{

	public static void main(String [] arg){
	
	int[] values={34,78,90,53,34,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11};
	
	if(i=i){}
	for(i=0;i<values.length;i++){
		System.out.println(i);
	}
	}

}

6)main method is method programruns. when is execuets the with respctive to method 
the program will be execuets in run time.
method syntix:
acsses,non-acess,returntype,mainmethod(parametares){

} 

7)reverse number
class Reverse{

	public static void main(String [] arg){
	int number=14675,reverse=0;
	int reminder;
	
	while(number>0){
	reminder = number%10;
	   number = number/10;
	   reverse = (reverse * 10)+ reminder;
	   
	  
	 }
	  System.out.println(reverse);
	
	
	
	}
}

8)hours into seconds
class Seconds{

	public static void main(String [] agr){
	int hours=2;
	int seconds=(hours*60*60);
	
	System.out.println(seconds);
	
	
	}


}
